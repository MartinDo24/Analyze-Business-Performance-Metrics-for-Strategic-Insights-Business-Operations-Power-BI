## ⚒️ Main Process 

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

-Delete duplicate, missing value, remove columns that unnecessary,... 

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

-Find the relationship between each table

-Find where is Dimtable where is Facttable

-Find which formula is necessary 

3️⃣ Create a measure table by DAX 

-Measure about AVG,  Margin, rate/sale growth ,total

4️⃣ Power BI Visualization

-Create a ouline 

-Choose chart or card to show the change or display indicators

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

### 🔍 Dashboard Preview

#### 1️⃣ Dashboard 1 Preview 

-Observation: The first dashboard shows total sales of $12.6M, total profit of $1.7M, and a low return rate of 0.04%, indicating strong overall performance. However, Japan has the highest return rate at 1.20%, and the return rate by product varies significantly, with Holmes Replacement Filter for HEPA Air Cleaner (25.00%) and Boston 16801 Nautilus Battery Pencil Sharpener (16.67%) showing high returns.
