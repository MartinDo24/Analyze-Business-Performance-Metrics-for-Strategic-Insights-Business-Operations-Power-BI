4️⃣ & 5️⃣ Prototype - Review

-Build Power BI dashbroad

## ⚒️ Main Process 

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

-Delete duplicate, missing value, remove columns that unnecessary,... 

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

-Find the relationship between each table

-Find where is Dimtable where is Facttable

-Find which formula is necessary 

3️⃣ Create a measure table by DAX 

-Measure about AVG,  Margin, rate/sale growth ,total

4️⃣ Power BI Visualization

-Create a ouline 

-Choose chart or card to show the change or display indicators

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

### 🔍 Dashboard Preview

#### 1️⃣ Dashboard 1 Preview 

-Observation: The first dashboard shows total sales of $12.6M, total profit of $1.7M, and a low return rate of 0.04%, indicating strong overall performance. However, Japan has the highest return rate at 1.20%, and the return rate by product varies significantly, the trend increase first half of the year but go down immediately in July from $1.3M to $0.7M. EMEA become key region of company but LATAM is at the alarm threshold again
-Recommendation: Need to have more promotional campaigns in the first 7 months of the year to launch more promotional programs to attract customers, continue to invest in sub-category Tables especially in the Africa region. Further consideration of optimal shipping options to the LATAM region

#### 2️⃣ Dashboard 2 Preview 

-Observation: The second dashboard highlights return details with a total of 23 returns and a 2.08% return rate, with products like Zebra GX420t Direct Thermal/Thermal Transfer Printer (33.33%) and Holmes Replacement Filter (25.00%) showing the highest return rates. Total return by country peaks in Mexico (10), while North region leads in returns by region (10). Sales returns by person show Chuck Magee with the highest at $4K.

-Recommendation: Need to take care of customer Shirley Daniels returned Hamilton Beach Stove, White office supplies Japan area with the highest return value and also take care customer named Jack leborn asked for feedback on the product if possible give him a voucher to experience more products. Review the carrier especialy second class shipping method has the highest return rate with 13 products returned accounting for $5.1K.

## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

Through this project, I have gained both technical and business insights:

✅ I learned how to build a business-oriented Power BI dashboard that addresses strategic questions from senior management.

✅ I developed a stronger understanding of key performance metrics such as profit margin, return rate, and regional performance.

✅ I practiced writing DAX measures to calculate complex KPIs (e.g., dynamic profit margin, return rate by product group).

✅ I improved my ability to visualize data effectively, choose the right chart types, and apply meaningful filters and drill-down paths.

✅ I learned how to gather and apply stakeholder feedback to improve usability and actionable insights.

✅ This project also helped me realize the importance of aligning data visualization with business goals.
